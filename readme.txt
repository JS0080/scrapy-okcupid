2. I just finished one scrapy project that scraped data from shopganz.com.  
It needs to login for scraping data.   

3. I developed scraping program which scraped person information including images from the dating web site(www.okcupid.com) by using python scrapy1.1.0.   
The program scraped 1000 people(you can change the number) at once by default.
