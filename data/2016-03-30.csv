"ComesTheDervish","t_selfsum"," I'm a sketchy mathematician who really likes gender ambiguity and climbing big things.

I also have good cheekbones. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_doingwithlife"," I'm doing a PhD in maths, and spend as much time as possible climbing rocks, and playing the guitar, and going on very cheap trips to places ostensibly to climb more things but also to have adventures and meet unusual people. Also in this category, I really like hitchiking and busking. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_reallygood"," The things I aspire to be really good at include sketchy maths, playing the guitar and the piano, and clawing my way up overhanging bits of rock.

I can also solve a Rubik's cube with only a small amount of confusion, juggle three balls for a short period of time and shuffle a deck of cards with one hand (except when I drop them all).

Oh, and I make good coffee. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_thinsaboutme"," The cheekbones, closely followed by the fact that I have no shame. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_favorite"," I'm more than a little obsessed with old fashioned rhythm & blues, like the Spencer Davis Group and early Rolling Stones.

It's socially unacceptable, but I also like country, albeit more Emmylou Harris than Dolly Parton.

Oh, and I have a soft spot for Hanoi Rocks, sadly I don't think the world was ready for glam-punk in 1981.

As for films, I like them to be stylish. Planet Terror is both stylish, features zombies, and the main character is a go go dancer with a machine gun for a leg.

And now the books section, with dating-website translations:

One of my favourite books is The Unbearable Lightness of Being. (This shows that I have hidden depths and an unconventional approach to life and casual romance.)

Other stand out books for me include A Clockwork Orange (i.e. I might have an excitingly dangerous side), The Passion of New Eve (showing that I'm not a believer in the gender binary), and The Master & Margarita (yes I have a secret urge to go naked broomstick riding).

I do spend more time reading Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams and Neil Gaiman than any of the stuff mentioned above. I used the Discworld points of the compass to explain rotating co-ordinate systems the other day. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_neverdowithout"," Universities: I'd never survive in the real world.
Rocks to climb on.
My guitar (made from spare parts when I was 14, I wanted to be
Brian May)
Coffee: with coffee, I am a better person who actually does
things.
Muesli: in fact I only get out of bed in the morning because I want
coffee and muesli. Sometimes, on special occasions, with Greek
yoghurt and honey....

Six is not a prime number so I'm stopping there. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_lotthinking"," I believe in the fundamental interconnectedness of all things, and
as such try to embrace a holistic approach to life, gender
confusion and mathematical physics. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_fridaynight"," Probably en route to some rocks with climbing equipment and a tent. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_admit"," I sometimes shave my legs, and I like the look on people's faces when they are shocked by that.

I can also enjoy unrestrained dancing while completely sober.

I sometimes feel very socially awkward, but as long as I'm comfortable saying 'Aargh human interactions are so difficult!' to someone, then I'm normally quite lucid. "
"ComesTheDervish","t_messageme"," You're one of the people who gave me lemons while I was busking in Leeds a few years ago. I prefer cash, but they did make some tasty lemonade....

OR, more seriously:

You want to go ski mountaineering.

You like taking photographs and want a model, or maybe you want a partner for acrobatics/climbing/surfing/urban exploration/board games/making music... or any combination of the above!

In general, I prefer meeting up with people to do things rather than just to consume expensive drinks and 'hang out'. Also, that doesn't just apply to dates - e.g. sitting in a park all day with a bottle of cider and a bunch of people that I really like is often actually quite a stressful day out for me. Having said that, I'm a sucker for cocktails. "
